Congratulations, you made it to the end of the course! We hope you enjoyed it.

### Summary
In this course, you learned how to work with NumPy arrays, indexing, slicing, and vectorized operations for matrix and multidimensional data. By applying linear algebra concepts — such as matrix multiplication and SVD — to real image data in the RGB approximation project, you saw how math models work in practice. 

You have gained practical skills in numerical computing that are essential for fields like machine learning, data science, and scientific programming.

Now, to perform the approximation, we must choose only the first `k` singular values 
for each color channel.

### Task
Try running this with different values of `k` - you can change it in the highlighted placeholder.

Even though the image is not as sharp, using only a small number of `k` singular values 
(compared to the original set of 408 values), we can recover many of the distinguishing 
features from this image.



**Do not forget to run the code! (&shortcut:Run;)**
